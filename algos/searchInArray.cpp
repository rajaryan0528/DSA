Given a list of N elements, which follows no particular arrangement, you are required to search an
element x in the list. The list is stored using array data structure. If the search is successful, the output
should be the index at which the element occurs, otherwise returns -1 to indicate that the element is
not present in the list. Assume that the elements of the list are all distinct. Write a program to perform
the desired task

Given a list of N elements, which is sorted in ascending order, you are required to search an element x
in the list. The list is stored using array data structure. If the search is successful, the output should be
the index at which the element occurs, otherwise returns -1 to indicate that the element is not present
in the list. Assume that the elements of the list are all distinct. Write a program to perform the desired
